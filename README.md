"Discovering IoT Devices on the internet" : Santosh Kumar (P21CS013) & Aditya Raturi (P21CS001)

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

-IoT devices are vulnerable to attacks that can be compromised easily due to a lack of security. To identify these devices on the internet we can use three methods - link devices with domain name services, detect server IP address, or link manufacturer TLS certificates for discovery. 
You can refer to the article - “Detecting IoT Devices on the Internet” for implementing the project. Use any of the three methods and show how a new IoT device can be discovered on the internet.

- Create a genuine use case. 
- You can use either simulator or can implement the project with hardware components if available.
